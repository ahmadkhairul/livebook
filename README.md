# Livebook

Drop page to flip book like in life! 

Made with react-spring and react-use-gesture libraries and with a lot of math caclulations.

Has some issues and features (TODO). 
Doesn't work in FF yet. And there is issue when user drag pages very fast. I haven't found good solution yet,as react-spring behaves unexpectable when I use "enabled" param.

Hope I will finish it in nearest future:)
